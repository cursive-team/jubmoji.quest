    description: `Unlike on-chain NFTs, all information is collected and stored on your own device.

You read right, you fully own your data!`,

    title: "Back up your data",
    description:
      "All collected jubmojis are stored in your browser's temporary storage, so it's important to back up your data to your mobile wallet or a password manager upon collection of each jubmoji. Then you can restore your collection if you accidentally close your browser tab.",
  },
  {
    title: "Need help tapping?",
    description: `Click the ‚ÄúAssisted tap‚Äù button on the main page, which will make it easier to collect Jubmojis from the cards. Hold it for 1-2s against the top of your phone if it's an iPhone, and the center of your phone if it's an Android.`,

  {
    title: `What is the ‚ÄúJub‚Äù in Jubmoji?`,
    description: `"Jub" comes from the term "Baby Jubjub Curve," the elliptic curve used for the card's signatures. It was found in 2019 by Barry WhiteHat, Marta Bell√©s, and Jordi Baylina.
    
    We use the Baby Jubjub Curve alongside zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to provide a secure and private way to manage your Jubmojis. ZKPs let you prove something without revealing all information. Simply put, the Baby Jubjub Curve provides a special lock for your memories, letting you safely share and verify your jubmojis without giving up your full data and privacy üóùÔ∏èüîí!`,
