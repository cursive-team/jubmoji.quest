    description:
      "All collected jubmojis are stored in your browser's temporary storage, so it's important to back up your data to your mobile wallet or a password manager upon collection of each jubmoji. Then you can  restore your collection if you accidentally close your browser tab.",

    title: `What is the ‚ÄúJub‚Äù in Jubmoji?`,
    description: `"Jub" comes from the term "Baby Jubjub Curve," which is a mathematical equation used to verify data securely.

    We use the Baby Jubjub Curve alongside zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to provide a secure and private way to manage your Jubmojis. ZKPs let you prove something without revealing all information. Simply put, the Baby Jubjub Curve is a special lock for your memories, letting you safely share and verify your jubmojis without giving up your full data and privacy üóùÔ∏èüîí!`,
